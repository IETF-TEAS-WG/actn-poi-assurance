Applicability of Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks
     (ACTN) for Packet Optical Integration (POI) service assurance
               draft-poidt-teas-actn-poi-assurance-latest

Abstract

   This document extends the analysis of the applicability of
   Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture to Packet
   Optical Integration (POI), provided in RFC YYYY, to cover multi-layer
   service assurance scenarios.  Specifically, the ACTN architecture
   enables the detection and handling of different failures that may
   happen either at the optical or the packet layer.  It is assumed that
   the underlying transport optical network carries end-to-end IP
   services such as L2VPN or L3VPN connectivity services, with specific
   Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements.

      RFC Editor: Please replace YYYY with the RFC number of draft-ietf-
      teas-actn-poi-applicability once it has been published.  Please
      remove this note.

   Existing IETF protocols and data models are identified for each
   multi-layer (packet over optical) service assurance scenario with a
   specific focus on the MPI (Multi-Domain Service Coordinator to
   Provisioning Network Controllers Interface) in the ACTN architecture.

1.  Introduction

   Service assurance is a critical aspect of Operations, Administration
   and Management (OAM).  It consists of activities and processes whose
   target is to guarantee a specified Service Level Agreement (SLA) to
   the customer of a telecommunication service.  Service assurance
   includes both fault management, for correcting or fixing the service
   anomalies and network faults, and performance management, for
   monitoring of the service and network parameters and early warning of
   potential service-related issues.

   In the scope of this document, service assurance is discussed in the
   context of a multi-layer, multi-domain network.  In doing so, it
   leverages on the Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN)
   framework [RFC8453] and further expands the analysis of its
   applicability into multi-layer packet-optical integrated networks
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] adding considerations specific
   to the fault and performance management scenarios.

   As already highlighted in [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability], a
   multi-layer network is composed of an IP layer and an optical
   transport layer.  A multi-domain network is composed of at least two
   different administrative domains (e.g. core and edge) under the
   control of the same organization (e.g. the same network operator).
   Service assurance applies to end-to-end L2VPN or L3VPN connectivity
   services configured over underlying transport optical paths that
   requires multi-layer coordination.

   To guarantee the SLAs associated to the VPN services, service
   assurance is performed through the collaboration of the different
   control entities part of the ACTN architecture [RFC8453]: the Multi-
   Domain Service Coordinator (MDSC), acting as the top-level
   controller, and the Provisioning Network Controllers (PNC) deployed
   both in the packet (PNC-P) and optical (PNC-O) layers.

   The document has the following organization: section 2 lists the
   conventions and definitions used in the text.  Section 3 discusses
   the reference network in scope for the relevant service assurance
   cases.  Section 4 identifies the YANG data models applicable to
   service assurance and provides a gap analysis for the modules that
   are still missing.  Section 5 identifies the possible faults, either
   in the optical or in IP layer (or both), in scope for this analysis.
   Section 6 deals with the performance management aspects of service
   assurance in a packet-optical integrated network.  Finally, section 7
   discusses the protection mechanisms available for the most typical
   fault scenarios of a multi-layer, multi-domain network.

   For each multi-technology scenario, the document analyzes how to use
   the interfaces and the data models of the ACTN architecture.

   A summary of the gaps identified in this analysis is provided in
   section 8.

   Understanding the level of standardization and the possible gaps will
   help assess the feasibility of integration between packet and optical
   DWDM domains (and optionally OTN layer) in an end-to-end multi-vendor
   service assurance perspective.

   This document analyses several scenarios for service assurance in
   Packet and Optical Integration (POI) in which ACTN hierarchy is
   deployed to control a multi-layer and multi-domain network with two
   optical domains and two packet domains, as shown in Figure 1 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability], which is copied in Figure 1

   In general, service assurance involves fault detection and
   localization; performance monitoring as well as re-routing
   (protection).

   Two cases will be considered:

   1.  using grey interfaces on routers' ports, as outlined in
       [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability]

   2.  using colored optical interfaces on routers' ports, as outlined
       in [I-D.mix-teas-actn-poi-extension]

   NOTE: It is not fully clear how much commonalities there are in
   service assurance for these two cases.  This draft will start
   addressing both cases.  At a later stage it will be assessed whether
   it is worthwhile keeping everything in a single draft or to split
   into two drafts.

   The MDSC is responsible for coordinating the whole multi-domain,
   multi-layer (packet and optical) network.  MDSC interacts with
   different Provisioning Network Controllers (O/P-PNCs) through the MPI
   interface.  The MPI interface presents an abstracted topology to
   MDSC, hiding the technology-specific aspects of the network and the
   topology details (depending on the policy chosen regarding the level
   of abstraction supported).

   Following the assumptions of section 2.1.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability], this document analyses
   scenarios where the MDSC uses the partial summarization approach to
   coordinate multi-domain/multi-layer path computation.

   In this approach, the MDSC has complete visibility of the TE topology
   of the packet network domains and an abstracted view of the TE
   topology of the optical network domains.  That means the MDSC has the
   capability of performing multi-domain/single-layer path computation
   for the packet layer.  The MDSC needs to delegate the O-PNCs to
   perform local path computation within their respective domains.  It
   uses the information received by the O-PNCs and its TE topology view
   of the multi-domain packet layer to perform multi-layer/multi-domain
   path computation.

   P-PNCs are responsible for setting up the TE paths between any two
   PEs or BRs in their respective controlled domains, as requested by
   MDSC, and providing topology information to the MDSC.

   O-PNCs are responsible to provide to the MDSC an abstract TE topology
   view of their underlying optical network resources.  They perform
   single-domain local path computation, when requested by the MDSC.
   They also perform optical tunnel setup, when requested by the MDSC.

   No GMPLS-UNI interaction between IP and Optical equipment is
   considered.  This is also the assumption followed in this document:
   the MDSC performs the function of multi-layer/multi-domain path
   computation through the same mechanisms described in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability].

   TO DO - Complete the description of the pre-requisites of MDSC in the
   cases discussed.

   The following list summarizes the main assumptions about how MDSC can
   handle the service assurance cases described in this document.  Most
   of them have been already described in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability]

   1.  MDSC has acquired all the topology and status information of both
       the IP and optical layers.

   2.  MDSC is fully aware of any multi-layer connections between the IP
       and the optical layers.  It is also aware of the multi-domain
       interconnection links between different IP domains.

   3.  MDSC is aware of any topology or resource utilization change
       obtained in real time through coordination with the O/P-PNCs.
       This applies in the case of a fault or a maintenance activity
       involving either the IP or the DWDM layer.

   4.  MDSC coordinates the IP and DWDM protections and, as a result,
       the re-routing of traffic at both the IP and DWDM layer.

   5.  Before planned maintenance operation at the DWDM layer, MDSC
       instructs the P-PNC to move the affected IP traffic to an other
       link in an hitless way.  This is done before the event takes
       place.  MDSC also coordinates with P-PNC to revert back the
       traffic on the original path when the maintenance event is
       concluded.

   6.  When the O-PNC detects a degradation of optical performance (e.g.
       BER PRE-FEC values threshold crossing over a certain period of
       time), it alerts the MDSC so that the MDSC relates the warning to
       an IP link.

   7.  MDSC distinguishes between IP and Optical failures.  For example,
       in the case of the failure of an IP port of a router, the IP
       traffic may be switched to a stand-by port, reusing the same
       ROADM optical resources (lambda, optical path) and keeping the
       end-to-end IP connection.  If a remote IP node fails, then a re-
       route of optical resources takes place together with a switch of
       the local IP port in order to establish a new connection with a
       different IP node used for protection.

   discuss the scenarios in in Section 7.

                        Figure 2: Reference Network

   The network consists of three Points of Presence (POPs)
   geographically distributed.  It is assumed that every POP hosts a
   Router (R1, R2, and R3 respectively) connected to a ROADM (ROADM1,
   ROADM2, and ROADM3).  All the routers connect to their co-located
   ROADMs with two Ethernet links (e.g. 100GE) for redundancy.  In their
   normal operations, the routers may employ any local policy for
   traffic steering.  For the scope of this document, it is assumed that
   the path that R1 uses to steer the IP traffic to R2 goes from port P1
   of R1 to port P1 of R2 (thus going through port P1 of R1, ports P1
   and P3 of ROADM1, ports P3 and P1 of ROADM2, port P1 of R2).  R1 uses
   port P2 to steer the traffic to R3 instead.  The IP link between R1
   and R3 carries the IP services that are directed to R3 and is used by
   R1 as a detour path (backup path) to reach R2 if a failure occurs in
   the primary path across ROADM1 and ROADM2.  The detour path also
   includes a second leg from R3 to R2.  The detour path from R1 to R2,
   then includes: port P2 of R1, ports P2 and P4 or ROADM1, ports P3 and
   P1 of ROADM3, ports P1 and P2 of R3, ports P2 and P4 of ROADM3, ports
   P4 and P2 of ROADM2, and port P2 of R2.  The connection between all
   ROADMs is based on two fibers.  The optical paths all cross an
   optical network.  For the scope of this document, it is assumed that
   some coordination mechanisms are employed at the optical layer so
   that when a failure happens on an optical path (for example, between
   ROADM1 and ROADM2), an optical backup path is activated.  The
   mechanisms are assumed to be coordinated by O-PNC and MDSC, even if
   other methods may be also considered (e.g.  G-MPLS based).  Further
   details are given in the use cases described in Section 7.

4.  YANG Data Models for the MPIs

   The analysis of the data models potentially of interest for this
   document is still on-going.  The set of YANG models identified so far
   includes the following items:

   *  ietf-alarms defined in [RFC8632]

   *  ietf-performance-monitoring defined in
      [I-D.yu-performance-monitoring-yang]

   *  A YANG Data Model for Service Assurance [RFC9418]

   *  A YANG Data Model for Network and VPN Service Performance
      Monitoring [RFC9375]

   The list will be progressively updated as the document evolves.

5.  Multi-layer Fault Management

   This section deals with the actions taken by the MDSC and the PNCs at
   the IP and optical layers to handle the occurence of a failure in a
   multi-layer network.  This set of actions is referred to as fault
   management and consists of steps such as fault detection, fault
   localization, and fault recovery.  Specifically, this section
   analyzes the detection and localization of a failure, while section
   {: #resiliency} further details the mechanisms for fault recovery.
   Depending on the point where a failure occurs, three use cases are
   considered: 1.  The failure occurs in the optical layer, for example
   a fiber cut that triggers a Loss of Signal (LOS) alarm.  This is
   discussed in section {: #optical-fault}. 2.  The failure occurs at
   the connection between a router and a ROADM (cross-layer link).  Such
   a case is analyzed in section {: #edge-fault}. 3.  The failure occurs
   in the IP layer, for example a router experiences a hardware failure
   on a port that connects to its optical counterpart.  This case is
   discussed in section {: #router-fault}.

5.1.  Reference scenario for multi-layer faults

   The following figure illustrates the reference scenario useful to
   discuss the fault management cases.

       Figure 3: Reference scenario for multi-layer fault management

   The MDSC is responsible for the correlation of the events.  The
   notification about a failure (alarm, state change, etc.) is sent from
   the P-PNC (upstream arrow labelled "1" in the figure) and/or the
   O-PNC (upstream arrow labelled "2"), depending on the case
   considered.  It has to be noted that only a single P-PNC is present
   in the network.  The second box marked with the label "P-PNC" is
   represented only to simplify the schematics.  Actually the P-PNC on
   the left and the P-PNC on the right are the same element.

   In case of a failure in the IP layer, the router that detects it
   sends a corresponding notifiation message to the P-PNC.  This is
   represented by the upstream arrow labbelled "a".  Similarly, a
   failure in the optical layer can be notified through messages sent by
   a ROADM (upstream arrow "b") or by a node within the optical core
   network (upstream arrow "c").  Again, depending on the specific case
   multiple messages can be directed by the IP and/or optical nodes to
   the corresponding PNC.

   For simplicity, a router is connected to a ROADM via two
   unidirectional fibers, represented by the two arrows between them.
   ROADM 1 and ROADM 2 are considered to be the edge nodes of a larger
   optical core that may include several other components.  The two
   connections between a router and a ROADM carry, in addition to data
   traffic, the signaling messages generated by the physical
   transmission layer, for example Local Failure Indication (LFI) or
   Remote Failure Indication (RFI).  These messages provide
   supplementary information that an IP or an optical node may consider
   for failure detection and for providing further details in the
   upstream notification to a PNC.

5.2.  Optical Network Failures

   In this case, the O-PNC is fully responsible for the fault management
   (including failure detection, location and repair) within the optical
   domain.

   The detailed mechanisms used by the O-PNC for intra-domain fault
   management are outside the scope of this document.  Optical data
   plane standards provide a comprehensive set of OAM tools, defined in
   [ITU-T_G.709] and [ITU-T_G.798], that would assist O-PNC fault
   management, as described in [ITU-T_G.7710] and [ITU-T_G.874].

   It is worth noting that the OAM tools, defined in [ITU-T_G.709] and
   [ITU-T_G.798], are fully standardized for the ODU, OTU and FlexO sub-
   layers but only functionally standardized for the optical medial
   layer (i.e., OCh and OTSiA).  This is not an issue since it is
   assumed that the optical NEs and O-PNC within a single domain are
   single-vendor.

   However, the level of standardization of the OAM tools management
   requirements is sufficient to allow defining standard requirements
   and data model at the MPI for multi-vendor, multi-domain and multi-
   layer fault management.

   Even if in this case the fault management is fully under the
   responsibility of the O-PNC, it is still needed to inform the MDSC
   that there is a failure within the optical domain and that the O-PNC
   is working on it.

   A failure within the optical network can cause secondary failure on
   multiple optical tunnels which can in turn cause failures on the
   multi-layer IP links and on the L2VPN and L3VPN services whose
   traffic is sent over the failed tunnels.

   For example, with a reference to Figure 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability], a failure within the optical
   network can cause a failure on the optical tunnel between NE11 and
   NE12.  As a consequence, also the IP link between PE13 and BR11 is
   failed and the L2VPN/L3VPN xxx is also affected.

   The O-PNC can report the operational status of the optical tunnels to
   the MDSC to let the MDSC know that the optical tunnel is down.  The
   MDSC can then correlate the failure of the optical tunnel (e.g., the
   optical tunnel between NE11 and NE12 in Figure 7 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability]) with the secondary failures
   on the L2VPN/L3VPN whose traffic has been routed through that optical
   tunnel.

      Comment: Need to discuss here why reporting the operational status
      of the optical tunnel is not sufficient to motivate the need for a
      more enhanced incident management as proposed in
      [I-D.feng-opsawg-incident-management]

   The MDSC should also inform the OSS/orchestration layer about the
   failures on the affected L2VPN/L3VPN services though mechanisms which
   are outside the scope of this document.

      Comment: Need further discussion about the behavior of P-PNC.  The
      P-PNC can also discover that the multi-layer IP link is down
      (e.g., using BFD).  However, I think that the fault management
      process in P-PNC should be different from the case where the
      failed IP link is a single-layer IP link under P-PNC
      responsibility.

      Comment: The assumption in this text is that there are grey
      interfaces between the routers and the optical NEs.  More
      investigation is needed for the scenarios where optical pluggable
      interfaces are used in the router.  Three scenarios for WDM
      networks: grey interfaces, colored interfaces option 1 and colored
      interfaces option 2.  To consider also the case with ODU
      switching.

5.3.  Cross-layer Link Failures

   The failures discussed in this section occur on the connection
   between a router and a ROADM.  A first case concerns the Tx fiber
   used by R1 to send traffic to ROADM1 ({: #fig-failure-ingress-link}).

               Figure 4: Failure on the optical ingress link

   The failure on that fiber is physically detected by ROADM1 that sends
   a corresponding notification to O-PNC and generates a Client Signal
   Fail (CSF) message along the optical path.  Upon receiving CSF,
   ROADM2 sends a LFI to R2.  If R2 is instructed to decode physical
   transmission messages, upon receiving LFI it generates a
   corresponding message to P-PNC, also informing of the loss of IP
   connectivity due to unreceived BFD messages.  At the physical level,
   R2 may generate on its Tx interface an RFI indication that is
   propagated downstream to the optical network (where a CSF is
   generated) and to R1.  When receiving RFI on its Rx interface, R1 can
   also send a notification to P-PNC.  When O-PNC and P-PNC get the
   notifications sent by the network elements, they also instruct MDSC.
   O-PNC informs MDSC of the link R1-ROADM1 down, while P-PNC informs
   MDSC that the corresponding IP link is down due to missed BFD
   signalling in addition to the RFI status.  It is up to the MDSC to
   correlate the events and determine what IP services are affected
   (VPNs, P2P links, etc.).

   A second case is depicted in figure {: #fig-failure-egress-link}. The
   failure happens on the Rx fiber used by R2 to receive traffic from
   ROADM2.

                Figure 5: Failure on the optical egress link

   R2 physically detects the absence of signal generating a
   corresponding LOS alarm to P-PNC.  In turn, P-PNC signals MDSC of the
   corresponding event affecting the link between ROADM2 and R2.  R2
   also propagates an RFI indication on the return fiber.  Upon
   detecting it, ROADM2 also informs O-PNC of the failure with a
   corresponding RFI status indication.  ROADM2 also propagates a CSF
   indication across the optical domain, translated to an RFI by ROADM1
   towards R1.  The RFI is detected by R1 that may inform P-PNC about
   the remote failure with an RFI status indication, if instructed to do
   so, and with a BFD down event notification when detecting missing
   connectivity.  As noted, MDSC correlates the events to determine the
   affected services.

   A failure may also occur when the two unidirectional fibers
   connecting a router, e.g.  R1, to a ROADM, e.g.  ROADM2, are
   affected, for example for a simultaneous fiber cut, as shown in
   figure {: #fig-failure-bidir-link}.

                    Figure 6: Failure on the access link

   Both Tx and Rx fibers are affected, then R1 and ROADM1 immediately
   detect physical LOS and inform P-PNC and O-PNC respectively.  ROADM1
   also triggers a CSF indication towards the optical core that
   eventually gets to ROADM2, which sends a LFI to R2.  R2 may detect
   this signal, informning P-PNC.  From the IP connectivity standpoint,
   after missing three BFD messages R2 also signals to P-PNC the lack of
   end-to-end connectivity.  It then generates a RFI indication back to
   ROADM2, which in turn sends a CSF indication on the optical return
   path.  Both P-PNC and O-PNC inform MDSC of the event affecting the
   link between R1 and ROADM1 for its successive correlation.

5.4.  Router Node Failures

   In this case it is assumed that a router port experiences a hardware
   failure, for example R1's port connecting to ROADM1.  R1 may have
   internal mechanisms that detect the failure and trigger the relevant
   notification to P-PNC.  At the IP level the missing reception of the
   BFD messages against R2 triggers a BFD down notification to P-PNC.
   the same notification is sent by R2, confirming that the IP
   connectivity is lost.

6.  Multi-layer Performance Management

   Optical devices employ mechanisms for monitoring the condition of an
   OTN link.  Among others, pre-Forward Error Correction (pre-FEC) Bit
   Error Rate (BER) allows to track bit errors on the optical wire,
   notifying the transmitter side or a controlling agent when a
   specified threshold is reached or passed.  The advantage of this
   mechanism is to get an early warning on the optical path performance:
   the exceeding of the specified threshold means that the receiver is
   no longer able to correct all the errors on the channel.  As a
   result, the transmitter or the controlling entity (e.g. an SDN
   controller) may trigger counter-actions such as the switch to a
   different optical path.

   Multi-layer performance managent is in scope of the present document.
   In this context it is assumed that: 1.  O-PNC is capable of
   monitoring the DWDM links optical performance, and alert MDSC when
   the pre-FEC BER value overcomes a user-specified threshold 2.  MDSC
   is capable of correlating the pre-FEC BEC threshold crossing alarm
   with a related IP link and take appropriate corrective actions, if
   programmed to do so.

   In this context, the assumption is that pre-FEC BER measurement is
   done on the optical path between ROADM1 and ROADM2.  Some IP services
   (e.g.  L2/L3 VPNs) are active between R1 and R2, using the optical
   path between ROADM1 and ROADM2 as a transport.  The sequence of steps
   to handle multi-layer performance managent by the MDSC is expected to
   be the following:

   *  step 1.  ROADM2 detects a pre-FEC BER value at an ingress
      interface higher that the defined threshold.  A corresponding
      alarm is sent to O-PNC

   *  step 2.  O-PNC forwards the alarm to MDSC

   *  step 3.  MDSC correlates the information of the optical path
      subject to pre-FEC BER issues and the IP services active on it.

   Depending on how the MDSC in instructed to react, different choices
   are possible.  At one extreme of the spectrum, the MDSC notes the
   event and simply trigger a notification to the operator.  At the
   other extreme, the MDSC may start the multi-layer resiliency
   mechanisms described in the next section, including fast-reroute at
   the IP layer.

7.  Multi-layer Resiliency

   The coordination of both the IP and the optical layer in the cases
   discussed in Section 7 requires the MDSC to be aware of some network
   capabilities and to exchange the corresponding information with both
   the P-PNC and the O-PNC.

   To achieve maximum flexibility, a network operator may enable or
   disable these capabilities.  Once the network operator has configured
   the capabilities described in this section, the MDSC exchanges the
   relevant configuration with the PNCs present in the network before
   the use cases described in Section 7 take place.

   The list of parameters that the MDSC may need to communicate to the
   PNCs includes:

   *  IP service reversion: on/off

   *  Optical service reversion: on/off

   *  Hold-off time: time in ms (0 for immediate fast re-routing)

   *  Wait time before reversion: time in s

   *  Recovery method used in the optical layer: protection/restoration

7.1.  Optical Network Failures

   Failures in the optical domain can be recovered by packet-based
   protection mechanisms as described in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability].

   This use case is characterized by a fault happening on the upper
   fiber connecting ROADM1 and ROADM2 (port P3 to port P3 as depicted in
   Figure 2), affecting the IP traffic between R1 and R2.  As a result,
   the MDSC and the domain controllers cooperate to find a backup path
   for the IP traffic.  If the optical layer does not employ any
   mechanisms, the case is typically solved through the Fast Rerouting
   Mechanisms (FRR) enabled by the IP/MPLS control plane.  With
   reference to figure Figure 2, this corresponds to using the
   combination of the two detour paths R1-R3 and R3-R2.  For the scope
   of this document, the assumption is instead that the optical layer
   supports its own mechanisms that have to interact with the IP layer.
   Two sub-cases are possible:

   1.  The optical layer supports restoration

   2.  The optical layer supports protection.

7.1.1.  Optical restoration

   As restoration typically sets an alternative path on the fly based on
   the availability of sufficient optical resources, the time taken by
   the process to create an optical backup tends to be longer than the
   time taken by the IP/MPLS FRR process.  As a result, the interaction
   between the two layers follows the mimics shown in the next figure.

             Figure 7: Fault detection with optical restoration

   More in details:

   *  step 1a.  The fault on the optical path (e.g. fiber cut, loss of
      signal, etc.) is detected by ROADM1 and notified to O-PNC

   *  step 2a.  O-PNC notifies the fault to MDSC

   *  step 1b.  R1 detects loss of end-to-end connectivity (e.g. 3
      missed BFD messages) and notifies P-PNC.  This step takes place
      almost simultaneously to 1a.

   *  step 2b.  P-PNC notifies the issue to MDSC

   *  step 3.  R1 starts a fast reroute process to enable a backup path
      at the IP/MPLS layer, using the already established detour through
      R3

   *  step 4.  R1 notifies P-PNC of the IP service switch through the
      alternate path (R1-R3 and R3-R2)

   *  step 5.  P-PNC notifies MDSC of the switch

   *  step 6.  ROADM1 and ROADM2 enable the restoration process.  Based
      on the mechanism adopted, there may be interaction between them

   *  step 7.  Both ROADM1 and ROADM2 notify O-PNC of the availability
      of an optical backup path

   *  step 8.  O-PNC notifies MDSC of the availability of an optical
      backup path

   *  step 9.  R1 detects again end-to-end connectivity through the
      initial path R1-R2 and, if configured to do so, revert the service

   *  step 10.  R1 notifies P-PNC of the switch to the initial path

   *  step 11.  P-PNC notifies the switch to MDSC.

   As noted in step 6., the restoration process may require an exchange
   of messages between ROADM1 and ROADM2.  This is not detailed in the
   present document as it is assumed that the relevant signaling is
   handled through O-PNC.

   In step 9., R1 detects again control traffic from R2.  The decision
   whether to revert the service on the initial path is local, e.g. it
   depends on the configuration made by the network operator.  Often,
   the IP equipment is configured to operate the reversion
   automatically, but there are cases where the network operator may
   prefer differently.

   At the end of the process, multi-layer hitless reversion may take
   place, again based on the configuration adopted by the network
   operator.  If multi-layer hitless reversion is adopted, then the
   process described in Section 7.5 takes place.

7.1.2.  Optical protection

   Differently from the previous case, here optical protection is
   considered.  This duration of this process is comparable with IP/MPLS
   FRR, as it is pre-computed.  As a consequence, when multi-layer
   coordination is enabled it is preferable to hold-off FRR on R1 and
   wait that optical protection is completed.  The process is shown in
   the next figure.

             Figure 8: Fault detection with optical protection

   The detailed process includes the following steps:

   *  step 1a.  The fault on the optical path (e.g. fiber cut, loss of
      signal, etc.) is detected by ROADM1 and notified to O-PNC

   *  step 2a.  O-PNC notifies the fault to MDSC

   *  step 1b.  R1 detects loss of end-to-end connectivity (e.g. 3
      missed BFD messages) and notifies P-PNC.  This step takes place
      almost simultaneously to 1a.

   *  step 2b.  P-PNC notifies the issue to MDSC [Editor's note: is this
      step necessary?]

   *  step 3.  R1 is configured to hold the FRR process, thus it waits
      for the corresponding value set by the hold-off time parameter

   *  step 4.  Optical protection is started by ROADM1, potentially
      involving an exchange of messages with O-PNC and ROADM2

   *  step 5.  Both ROADM1 and ROADM2 notify O-PNC of the availability
      of an optical backup path

   *  step 6.  O-PNC notifies MDSC of the availability of an optical
      backup path

   *  step 7.  R1 detects again end-to-end connectivity with R2.

   The IP traffic is recovered as soon as the optical protection is
   completed with no action taken by the IP routers.

   As in the previous use case, when the failure is fixed the network
   operator may desire to bring the service back to the original
   configuration.  If this is the case, multi-layer hitless reversion,
   as described in Section 7.5, takes place to move the service back to
   the initial network setup.

7.2.  Optical Network Maintenance

   Before planned maintenance operation on the optical network takes
   place, the IP traffic affected by the maintenance operation should be
   moved hitlessly to another link.  The MDSC and the P-PNC have to
   coordinate to reroute the traffic before the event happens.  In such
   a case the IP traffic needs to be locked to the protection route
   until the maintenance event is finished, unless a fault occurs on
   such path.  In this example, it is supposed that the link undergoing
   maintenance activity is the one from ROADM1 to ROADM2, affecting the
   IP traffic steered from R1 to R2.  A few minutes before the
   maintenance window, the MDSC starts the process that brings to the
   hitless re-routing of the affected IP traffic.  That means the IP
   backup path (through R3) is available and it is used only for the
   time requested by the optical plane to do maintenance.  The path
   R1-R3 should not be overloaded, unless the network operator accepts
   some possible traffic losses.  At the optical layer, the maintenance
   activity has no impact on traffic as a new path is configured upfront
   and the optical service does not revert to the original link until
   the maintenance window is finished.  At the of maintenance, the
   network configuration is moved back to the initial configuration
   using, if the network operator has chosen so, the multi-layer hitless
   reversion process discussed in Section 7.5.

   The next figure shows the process adopted to handle the maintenance
   window.

                   Figure 9: Maintenance window operation

   The steps include the following:

   *  step 1.  MDSC requires P-PNC to steer the IP service to a backup
      path (R1-R3-R2).  This is necessary to avoid loss of service
      before maintenance starts

   *  step 2.  P-PNC signals R1 to switch IP service to the backup path

   *  step 3.  R1 switches to backup path and acks to P-PNC

   *  step 4.  P-PNC acks to MDSC

   *  step 5.  MDSC instructs O-PNC to enable the process to create an
      optical backup path

   *  step 6.  O-PNC instructs ROADM1 and ROADM2 to enable a backup path

   *  step 7.  ROADM1 and ROADM2 acknowledge to O-PNC

   *  step 8.  O-PNC acknowledges to MDSC

   *  step 9.  MDSC instructs O-PNC to disable the primary optical path,
      initially used, and switch to the optical backup path

   *  step 10.  O-PNC instructs ROADM1 and ROADM2 to switch

   *  step 11.  ROADM1 and ROADM2 acknowledge to O-PNC

   *  step 12.  O-PNC acknowledges to MDSC

   *  step 13.  MDSC requires P-PNC to move revert the IP service back
      to the primary path (R1-R2)

   *  step 14.  P-PNC signals R1 to switch IP service to the primary
      path (carried over the optical backup path)

   *  step 15.  R1 switches to backup path and acknowledges to P-PNC

   *  step 16.  P-PNC acknowledges to MDSC

   *  step 17.  The maintenance activity follows.

   Once the activity is over, the network operator may wish to bring the
   whole configuration back to the IP and optical primary paths.  In
   such a case, multi-layer hitless reversion may be performed, as
   described in Section 7.5.

7.3.  Cross-layer Link Failures

   This case is characterized by having R1 configured with N ports
   working (say, P1-P3) and 1 spare port (PP) left as the protection of
   the other N.  In case of failure, for example of port P1, PP is
   dynamically activated and the traffic originally directed to P1 is
   steered to PP.  PP receives the same configuration of P1 while P1 is
   brought in a down state.  Differently from ordinary LAG, the traffic
   is not redistributed over the surviving links.  Since a backup port
   (PP) is enabled, the traffic keeps on flowing on N links instead of
   N-1.  If on the IP layer this scenario introduces the complexity of
   handling an extra port both on R1 and ROADM1, on the optical layer
   the configuration, as depicted in figure Figure 2, does not change as
   only N optical channels (e.g. lambdas) are used, as shown in figure
   Figure 10.

                   Figure 10: Use of N:1 protection on R1

   Two sub-cases may be considered, depending on the availability of a
   Muxponder or a Transponder on ROADM1.  If a Muxponder is used, then
   the optical P1 and PP are hosted on the same optical complex (e.g.
   board) on the customer's edge of ROADM1.  It is the optical complex
   that selects the input source of the signals and maps it on the
   proper lambda.  If instead a Transpoder is used, then it's ROADM1's
   internal matrix that switches from the input source from P1 to PP,
   cross-connecting the signal to the output lambda.  It has to be noted
   that the mechanism to deal with the on-the-fly reconfiguration of a
   router's port is out of the scope of the present document and may be
   subject of a dedicated draft.

   The next figure shows the process adopted to handle N:1 port
   protection.

   The sequence of steps is detailed.

   *  step 1.  R1 detects port P1 failure and notifies P-PNC

   *  step 2.  P-PNC notifies MDSC of the failure

   *  step 3.  R1 triggers FRR to protect the IP flows steering

   *  step 4.  R1 informs P-PNC of the switch to the backup path

   *  step 5.  P-PNC notifies MDSC of the traffic switch

   *  step 6.  R1 handles the mechanism to replicate the configuration
      of P1 to PP

   *  step 7.  R1 informs P-PNC that PP is up and ready to forward
      traffic

   *  step 8.  P-PNC notifies MDSC that port PP is up and ready to
      forward traffic

   *  step 9.  MDSC requires O-PNC to reconfigure ROADM1 access (both in
      the case of muxponder and transponder) and WDM connectivity if a
      transponder is used

   *  step 10.  O-PNC signals ROADM1 to reconfigure access (muxponder/
      transponder) and WDM connectivity (transponder)

   *  step 11.  ROADM1 acknowledges to O-PNC

   *  step 12.  O-PNC acknowledges to MDSC

   *  step 13.  MDSC requires P-PNC to revert to the initial (primary)
      path

   *  step 14.  P-PNC notifies R1 to revert to initial (primary) path

   *  step 15.  R1 notifies P-PNC of IP service switch and new port in
      use

   *  step 16.  P-PNC notifies MDSC of service switch and new port in
      use

   As in the previous cases, when port P1 on R1 is fixed, multilayer
   reversion Section 7.5 to the initial configuration may happen. that
   is dependent on the network operator's preference.

7.4.  Router Node Failures

   As shown in Figure 2, in its normal operations R1 is dual-homed to R2
   and R3.  Even if highly unlikely due to the usual redundancy deployed
   in field, this case considers a full failure of R2 (node failure).
   The implications of such an event are useful to discuss the
   interaction between the IP and the optical layers through the MDSC
   coordination.  The underlying assumption is that it is not possible
   to R2 to communicate to P-PNC about the event causing the failure, so
   it is up to R1 to detect it and to communicate instead to P-PNC.  The
   first reaction to the event is to perform a fast-rerouting action and
   move the traffic from the R1-R2 link to the R1-R3 link.  As part of
   the assumption, the R1-R3 IP link has been previously dimensioned to
   carry a certain amount of traffic, so it is possible that after fast
   re-routing takes place some traffic previously carried on the R1-R2
   IP link and now shifted to R1-R3 is discarded, for example because
   congestion occurs.  MDSC instructs the optical layer to find
   available optical resources, activate a new optical path between
   ROADM1 and ROADM3 and finally move the traffic previously associated
   to R1-R2 to the newly created optical path.  When this second optical
   path is available, MDSC triggers a new switch of the traffic so that
   R1 can now steers the previous R1-R2 traffic to the new optical path.
   The final configuration is shown in figure Figure 12.

   *  step 1.  R1 detects R2's failure and triggers IP FRR finding R3 as
      the next hop

   *  step 2.  R1 notifies P-PNC that R2 is down and FRR has started

   *  step 3.  P-PNC notifies MDSC of the events

   *  step 4.  Upon moving the R1-R2 traffic (or part of it) on R1-R3
      path, R1 notifies P-PNC of the service switch

   *  step 5.  P-PNC notifies MDSC of th eswitch

   *  step 6.  MDSC requires O-PNC to compute a new optical path between
      ROADM1 and ROADM3

   *  step 7.  O-PNC instructs both ROADM1 and ROADM3 to configure a new
      optical service

   *  step 8.  Both ROADM1 and ROADM3 inform O-PNC that the backup path
      is available

   *  step 9.  O-PNC informs MDSC that the backup path is available

   *  step 10.  MDSC computes a new IP path between R1 and R3, provides
      the relevant information to P-PNC and triggers switch

   *  step 11.  P-PNC transfers the information received to R1 and
      triggers R1 to switch traffic

   *  step 12.  R1 informs P-PNC of the service switch

   *  step 13.  P-PNC informs MDSC of the service switch.

7.5.  Multi-layer hitless reversion

   In some cases, the mechanisms employed by the optical layer to revert
   to the original setup may cause disruption at the IP layer, if proper
   coordination is not enabled.  As this may cause traffic loss, if the
   optical reversion is requested by the network operator, multi-layer
   coordination under the supervision of the MDSC is necessary.  The
   effect of multi-layer coordination is to bring the whole network,
   i.e. both the IP and the optical layers, back to their initial
   configuration after the recovery from a failure.  In particular, the
   process described in this section relies on the hitless switching
   capability of the IP layer.  Depending on the specific configuration,
   the procedure can be enabled at the end of the use cases described in
   Section 7.  The decision whether to apply it or not has to be
   evaluated by the network operator considering different factors,
   including the relative complexity of the process and the effects of
   its steps on the live traffic.

   To move back to the initial network configuration the MDSC has to
   follow a sequence of steps:

   *  Force the IP layer to switch the traffic flow(s) on another path,
      e.g. an alternative/backup path

   *  Trigger the optical layer to coordinate the reversion to the
      initial setup, e.g. disable an optical backup path and enable
      connectivity on the previously used primary path

   *  Force again the IP layer to switch back to the original path.  The
      actions on the IP layer are handled so that the IP traffic is
      switched only after the interface queues are emptied, guaranteeing
      a hitless switching.

   The mimics of the steps requested is shown in the next figure.

   Figure 5.2 Diagram for hitless multi-layer reversion

   The steps illustrated in the previous figure are detailed here:

   *  step 1.  ROADM1 detects the optical signal is up again on the
      previously broken fiber and notifies O-PNC

   *  step 2.  O-PNC notifies MDSC of the fiber up event

   *  step 3.  MDSC requires P-PNC to move the affected IP service(s) to
      an alternative/backup path (this path may vary according to the
      scenarios explained later).  Being a hitless switch, it is
      necessary to avoid loss of service

   *  step 4.  P-PNC signals R1 to switch the IP service(s) to the
      alternative/backup path

   *  step 5.  R1 switches the service(s) to the alternative/backup path
      and notifies P-PNC

   *  step 6.  P-PNC confirms the switch to MDSC

   *  step 7.  MDSC instructs O-PNC to disable the optical protection
      path (which may vary according to the scenarios detailed later)
      and activate again the optical primary path

   *  step 8.  O-PNC instructs both ROADM1 and ROADM2 to disable the
      optical protection path and activate the primary one

   *  step 9.  ROADM1 and ROADM2 acknowledge to O-PNC

   *  step 10.  O-PNC acknowledges to MDSC

   *  step 11.  MDSC requires P-PNC to revert the IP service(s) back to
      the primary path

   *  step 12.  P-PNC signals R1 to switch the IP service(s) to primary
      path

   *  step 13.  R1 switches and acknowledges to P-PNC

   *  step 14.  P-PNC acknowledges to MDSC.
