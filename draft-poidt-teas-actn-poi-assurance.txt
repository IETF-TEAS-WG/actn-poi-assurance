Applicability of Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks
     (ACTN) for Packet Optical Integration (POI) service assurance
               draft-poidt-teas-actn-poi-assurance-latest

Abstract

   This document extends the analysis of the applicability of
   Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture to Packet
   Optical Integration (POI), provided in RFC YYYY, to cover multi-layer
   service assurance scenarios, for end-to-end customer L2VPN or L3VPN
   connectivity services setup over underlying transport optical paths,
   with specific Service Level Agreement (SLA) requirements.

   EDITORS NOTE: Replace RFC YYYY with the RFC number of draft-ietf-
   teas-actn-poi-applicability once it has been published.

   Existing IETF protocols and data models are identified for each
   multi-layer (packet over optical) service assurance scenario with a
   specific focus on the MPI (Multi-Domain Service Coordinator to
   Provisioning Network Controllers Interface) in the ACTN architecture.

1.  Introduction

   TODO Complete the Introduction

   Multi-layer and multi-domain service assurance scenarios, based on
   the reference network described in section 2 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] and very relevant for Service
   Providers, are described in sections Section 5 and Section 6.

   This document is focusing on service assurance for end-to-end L2VPN
   or L3VPN connectivity services setup over underlying transport
   optical paths that requires multi-layer coordination

   For each scenario, existing IETF YANG data models, identified in
   section Section 4, are analyzed with a particular focus on the MPI in
   the ACTN architecture.

   For each multi-layer scenario, the document analyzes how to use the
   interfaces and data models of the ACTN architecture.

   A summary of the gaps identified in this analysis is provided in
   Section 7.

   Understanding the level of standardization and the possible gaps will
   help assess the feasibility of integration between packet and optical
   DWDM domains (and optionally OTN layer) from an end-to-end multi-
   vendor service assurance perspective.

3.  Reference Network Architecture

   This document analyses several scenarios for service assurance in
   Packet and Optical Integration (POI) in which ACTN hierarchy is
   deployed to control a multi-layer and multi-domain network with two
   optical domains and two packet domains, as shown in Figure 1 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability], which is copied in Figure 1
   below.

   In general, service assurance involves fault detection and
   localization; performance monitoring as well as re-routing
   (protection).

   Two cases will be considered:

   1.  using grey interfaces on routers' ports, as outlined in
       [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability]

   2.  using colored optical interfaces on routers' ports, as outlined
       in [I-D.mix-teas-actn-poi-extension]

   NOTE: It is not fully clear how much commonalities there are in
   service assurance for these two cases.  This draft will start
   addressing both cases.  At a later stage it will be assessed whether
   it is worthwhile keeping everything in a single draft or to split
   into two drafts.

   The MDSC is responsible for coordinating the whole multi-domain,
   multi-layer (packet and optical) network.  MDSC interacts with
   different Provisioning Network Controllers (O/P-PNCs) through the MPI
   interface.  The MPI interface presents an abstracted topology to
   MDSC, hiding the technology-specific aspects of the network and the
   topology details (depending on the policy chosen regarding the level
   of abstraction supported).

   Following the assumptions of section 2.1.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability], this document analyses
   scenarios where the MDSC uses the partial summarization approach to
   coordinate multi-domain/multi-layer path computation.

   In this approach, the MDSC has complete visibility of the TE topology
   of the packet network domains and an abstracted view of the TE
   topology of the optical network domains.  That means the MDSC has the
   capability of performing multi-domain/single-layer path computation
   for the packet layer.  The MDSC needs to delegate the O-PNCs to
   perform local path computation within their respective domains.  It
   uses the information received by the O-PNCs and its TE topology view
   of the multi-domain packet layer to perform multi-layer/multi-domain
   path computation.

   P-PNCs are responsible for setting up the TE paths between any two
   PEs or BRs in their respective controlled domains, as requested by
   MDSC, and providing topology information to the MDSC.

   O-PNCs are responsible to provide to the MDSC an abstract TE topology
   view of their underlying optical network resources.  They perform
   single-domain local path computation, when requested by the MDSC.
   They also perform optical tunnel setup, when requested by the MDSC.

   No GMPLS-UNI interaction between IP and Optical equipment is
   considered.  This is also the assumption followed in this document:
   the MDSC performs the function of multi-layer/multi-domain path
   computation through the same mechanisms described in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability].

   TO DO - Complete the description of the pre-requisites of MDSC in the
   cases discussed.

   The following list summarizes the main assumptions about how MDSC can
   handle the service assurance cases described in this document.  Most
   of them have been already described in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability]

   1.  MDSC has acquired all the topology and status information of both
       the IP and optical layers.

   2.  MDSC is fully aware of any multi-layer connections between the IP
       and the optical layers.  It is also aware of the multi-domain
       interconnection links between different IP domains.

   3.  MDSC is aware of any topology or resource utilization change
       obtained in real time through coordination with the O/P-PNCs.
       This applies in the case of a fault or a maintenance activity
       involving either the IP or the DWDM layer.

   4.  MDSC coordinates the IP and DWDM protections and, as a result,
       the re-routing of traffic at both the IP and DWDM layer.

   5.  Before planned maintenance operation at the DWDM layer, MDSC
       instructs the P-PNC to move the affected IP traffic to an other
       link in an hitless way.  This is done before the event takes
       place.  MDSC also coordinates with P-PNC to revert back the
       traffic on the original path when the maintenance event is
       concluded.

   6.  When the O-PNC detects a degradation of optical performance (e.g.
       BER PRE-FEC values threshold crossing over a certain period of
       time), it alerts the MDSC so that the MDSC relates the warning to
       an IP link.

   7.  MDSC distinguishes between IP and Optical failures.  For example,
       in the case of the failure of an IP port of a router, the IP
       traffic may be switched to a stand-by port, reusing the same
       ROADM optical resources (lambda, optical path) and keeping the
       end-to-end IP connection.  If a remote IP node fails, then a re-
       route of optical resources takes place together with a switch of
       the local IP port in order to establish a new connection with a
       different IP node used for protection.

   analysis:

   protection mechanisms as described in
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability].

   poidt-teas-poi-assurance.pptx (slide 3)

5.4.  Maintenance

   TODO Describe how the MDSC initiates protection switching at the IP
   layer (e.g., FRR) and at optical layer at the beginning of a
   maintenance window, including the reversion after the maintenance
   operations are completed: see for example the maintenance scenario in
   https://github.com/italobusi/draft-poidt-teas-actn-poi-assurance/
