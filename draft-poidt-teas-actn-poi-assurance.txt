Applicability of Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks
     (ACTN) for Packet Optical Integration (POI) service assurance
               draft-poidt-teas-actn-poi-assurance-latest

Abstract

   This document extends the analysis of the applicability of
   Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture to Packet
   Optical Integration (POI), provided in RFC YYYY, to cover service
   assurance scenarios.

   EDITORS NOTE: Replace RFC YYYY with the RFC number of [I-D.ietf-teas-
   actn-poi-applicability] once it has been published.

   Existing IETF protocols and data models are identified for each
   multi-layer (packet over optical) service assurance scenario with a
   specific focus on the MPI (Multi-Domain Service Coordinator to
   Provisioning Network Controllers Interface)in the ACTN architecture.

1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

   Multi-layer and multi-domain service scenarios, based on the
   reference network described in section 2 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] and very relevant for
   Service Providers, are described in sections Section 5 and Section 6.

   For each scenario, existing IETF YANG data models, identified in
   section Section 4, are analyzed with a particular focus on the MPI in
   the ACTN architecture.

   For each multi-layer scenario, the document analyzes how to use the
   interfaces and data models of the ACTN architecture.

   A summary of the gaps identified in this analysis is provided in
   Section 7.

   Understanding the level of standardization and the possible gaps will
   help assess the feasibility of integration between packet and optical
   DWDM domains (and optionally OTN layer) in an end-to-end multi-vendor
   service assurance perspective.

3.  Reference Network Architecture

   This document analyses several scenarios for service assurance in
   Packet and Optical Integration (POI) in which ACTN hierarchy is
   deployed to control a multi-layer and multi-domain network with two
   optical domains and two packet domains, as shown in Figure 1 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability], which is copied in
   Figure 1 below.

       Figure 1: Reference Network (copy of Figure 1 of RFC YYYY)

   EDITORS NOTE: Replace RFC YYYY with the RFC number of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] once it has been published.

   In general, assurance involves detection and localization of link
   failures and performance degradation as well as re-routing
   (protection).

   Two cases will be considered: 1. using grey interfaces on routers'
   ports, as outlined in [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] 2. using
   colored optical interfaces on routers' ports, as outlined in
   [I-D.mix-teas-actn-poi-extension]

   NOTE: It is not fully clear how much commonalities there are in
   service assurance for these two cases.  This draft will start
   addressing both cases and assess at a later stage whether it is
   worthwhile keeping everything in a single draft or to split into two
   drafts.

   The MDSC is responsible for coordinating the whole multi-domain,
   multi-layer (packet and optical) network.  MDSC interacts with
   different Provisioning Network Controllers (O/P-PNCs) through the MPI
   interface.  The MPI interface presents an abstracted topology to
   MDSC, hiding the technology-specific aspects of the network and the
   topology details (depending on the policy chosen regarding the level
   of abstraction supported).

   Following the assumptions of section 2.1.2 of
   [I-D.ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability], this document analyses
   scenarios where the MDSC uses the partial summarization approach to
   coordinate multi-domain/multi-layer path computation.

   In this approach, the MDSC has complete visibility of the TE topology
   of the packet network domains and an abstracted view of the TE
   topology of the optical network domains.  That means the MDSC has the
   capability of performing multi-domain/single-layer path computation
   for the packet layer.  The MDSC needs to delegate the O-PNCs to
   perform local path computation within their respective domains.  It
   uses the information received by the O-PNCs and its TE topology view
   of the multi-domain packet layer to perform multi-layer/multi-domain
   path computation.

   P-PNCs are responsible for setting up the TE paths between any two
   PEs or BRs in their respective controlled domains, as requested by
   MDSC, and providing topology information to the MDSC.

   O-PNCs are responsible to provide to the MDSC an abstract TE topology
   view of their underlying optical network resources.  They perform
   single-domain local path computation, when requested by the MDSC.
   They also perform optical tunnel setup, when requested by the MDSC.

   No GMPLS-UNI interaction between IP and Optical equipment is
   considered.  This is also the assumption followed in this document:
   the MDSC performs the function of multi-layer/multi-domain path
   computation through the same mechanisms described in (I-D.ietf-teas-
   actn-poi-applicability) even if that is applied to the maintenance
   and protection cases described in the next sections.

5.3.  Protection Switching

   TODO Describe how the MDSC coordinates the protection switching
   mechanisms at the IP layer (e.g., FRR) and at optical layer,
   including the reversion when the failure is repaired: see for example

5.4.  Maintenance

   TODO Describe how the MDSC initiates protection switching at the IP
   layer (e.g., FRR) and at optical layer at the beginning of a
   maintenance window, including the reversion after the maintenance
   operations are completed: see for example the maintenance scenario in
   https://github.com/italobusi/draft-poidt-teas-actn-poi-assurance/
