Applicability of Abstraction and Control of Traffic Engineered Networks
     (ACTN) for Packet Optical Integration (POI) service assurance
               draft-poidt-teas-actn-poi-assurance-latest

Abstract

   This document extends the analysis of the applicability of
   Abstraction and Control of TE Networks (ACTN) architecture to Packet
   Optical Integration (POI), provided in RFC YYYY, to cover service
   assurance scenarios.

   EDITORS NOTE: Replace RFC YYYY with the RFC number of [I-D.ietf-teas-
   actn-poi-applicability] once it has been published.

   Existing IETF protocols and data models are identified for each
   multi-layer (packet over optical) service assurance scenario with a
   specific focus on the MPI (Multi-Domain Service Coordinator to
   Provisioning Network Controllers Interface)in the ACTN architecture.

1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

   Multi-layer and multi-domain service scenarios, based on the
   reference network described in section 2 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability] and very relevant for
   Service Providers, are described in sections Section 5 and Section 6.

   For each scenario, existing IETF YANG data models, identified in
   section Section 4, are analyzed with a particular focus on the MPI in
   the ACTN architecture.

   For each multi-layer scenario, the document analyzes how to use the
   interfaces and data models of the ACTN architecture.

   A summary of the gaps identified in this analysis is provided in
   Section 7.

   Understanding the level of standardization and the possible gaps will
   help assess the feasibility of integration between packet and optical
   DWDM domains (and optionally OTN layer) in an end-to-end multi-vendor
   service assurance perspective.

3.  Reference Network Architecture

   This document analyses several scenarios for service assurance in
   Packet and Optical Integration (POI) in which ACTN hierarchy is
   deployed to control a multi-layer and multi-domain network with two
   optical domains and two packet domains, as shown in Figure 1 of
   [I-D.draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability], which is copied in
   Figure 1 below.

   scenario in https://github.com/italobusi/draft-poidt-teas-actn-poi-
   assurance/files/10885907/2023.03.draft-poidt-teas-poi-assurance.pptx
