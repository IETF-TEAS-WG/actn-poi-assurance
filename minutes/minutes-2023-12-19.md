## Discussion

The target is to have an updated draft to present to TEAS WG by IETF 119 with some technical material to justify the work on a new draft

### Scenarios from TIM (issue #1)

Reviewed the latest update to the slides from Fabio/Italo/Paolo:

#### Dual-homing and node failure scenario

The suggestion is to setup the green back-up path as disjoint from the yellow working path

This is a generic issue to be considered for all the multi-layer recovery scenarios in order to avoid that a single failure is going to affect both primary and reverse IP FRR paths

A gap has been identified in this issue since there is a need to request the setup of disjoint paths that belong to different tunnels

Steps 11 and 12 are optional since they depend on the IP FRR configuration: if IP FRR is revertive, R1 can switch the traffic to the dashed green path automatically as soon as the dashed green path becomes available

In the description we can mention that the dashed green path can go to R3, in case of dual-homing, or to another router (e.g., R4), in case of multi-homing.

#### Alert in case of degrade of DWDM link performance

The scenario for degraded WDM link requires further discussion with Fabio. As written in the original slides, the scenario is not a recovery scenario nor a multi-layer coordination scenario since it requires the ROADM to report whether the pre-FEC BER is above a given configured threshold.

One possibility is that this alert is used to trigger IP FRR protection for preventive traffic recovery.

However, with the new FEC algorithms, it seems hard to predict when the FEC will stop correcting errors in time to perform preventive traffic recovery. This is an issue to discuss with FEC experts to see if there other parameters to monitor for preventive traffic recovery.
