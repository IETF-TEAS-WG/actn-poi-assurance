For IETF 118, we will not present this draft at the meeting

### Scenarios from TIM (issue #1)

The contribution updated by Paolo [2023.09.draft-poi-assurance-fp-ib-pv_v4.pptx](https://github.com/italobusi/draft-poidt-teas-actn-poi-assurance/files/12859252/2023.09.draft-poi-assurance-fp-ib-pv_v4.pptx) has been reviewed

There has been some discussion on the validity of the scenario with optical protection with an hold-off timer for IP FRR. In this case, a failure on the lin between the router and the edge optical switch will take longer (e.g., 150ms) to be recovered.

It ahs been noted that there are some deployments in the network using optical protection with FRR and hold-off time and that the draft is intended to describe a set of tools/options without being prescriptive. It is up to the operator to choose which tool to deploy in his network bases on its policy and resilience requirements.
