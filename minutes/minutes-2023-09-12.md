## Discussion

Question from Prasenjit about the relationship with the [draft-gstk-ccamp-actn-optical-transport-mgmt](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-gstk-ccamp-actn-optical-transport-mgmt)

It seems the work is complimentary with the ACTN POI assurance I-D.

To be checked with Daniel: see new issue #9

Jeff: when discussion assurance we need to consider service assurance and multi-layer failure scenario to allow the MDSC to know where the issue is. In the context of pluggable we need standard reports from the O-PNC about the OLS part and from the P-PNC about the pluggable.

The current working assumption is to analyze assurance in both the aggregated scenarios as well as the pluggable scenarios assuming that the procedures are similar.

### I-D Refresh

The I-D will expire on September 14, 2023

**Action (Italo)**: Submit a new -01 revision just to avoid expiration

There are some issues with the automatic tool to upload the new revision from github

**Action (Prasenjit/Italo)**: check if it is possible to fix the tooling issue

If the tooling issue cannot be fixed in time, we can do a manual submission

See: https://github.com/martinthomson/i-d-template/blob/main/doc/SUBMITTING.md#github-release

### Scenarios from TIM (issue #1)

The contribution prepared by Paolo, Fabio and Italo [2023.06.draft-poi-assurance-fp-ib-pv_v3](https://github.com/italobusi/draft-poidt-teas-actn-poi-assurance/files/12584071/2023.06.draft-poi-assurance-fp-ib-pv_v3.pptx) has been reviewed

The contribution analyzes in details the scenarios provided by Fabio with some workflows describing the interactions between MDSC, O-PNC, P-PNC, routers and ROADM nodes

#### Failure within the optical network

Need to clarify that in case of optical dynamic restoration the optical backup path is not pre-configured as in the 1+1 protection case, but dynamically setup after the failure. Therefore, performing protection switching in the IP layer allows recovery the IP traffic in sub-50ms

Need to clarify that the reversion of the optical path is similar to a maintenance operation and the MDSC takes an active role to coordinate the switching in the IP layer and the reversion in the Optical layer to avoid traffic hit

The slides can be reviewed offline and comments exchanged on github or via e-mail before the next call
