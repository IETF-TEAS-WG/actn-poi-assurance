## Discussion

- Look to prepare new version of ACTN POI Assurance and discuss on next call (Feb 13th) so we can submit before the IETF 119 deadline. 

### Text proposal for resilience (PR #10)

Agreed to change the ToC with few comments:
- generalize section 7.3 to cover failures of the cross-layer link between the router and the edge optical NE

Paolo will finalize the text and open the PR for review: target for the review comments is the next call on February 13

Paolo can prepare in parallel some text proposal for the additional scenarios (cross-layer link failure and IP router failure)

Italo and Paolo will check the possibility to have multiple PRs to allow preparing new text proposals in parallel with PR review
