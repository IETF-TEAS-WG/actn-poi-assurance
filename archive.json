Fabio\u2019s slides depicts most those uses-cases in optical domain. There are PSM(protection switching module) modules can provide 50ms switchover in case of LOS. In rest of the cases, Optical PCE will come into picture. It will take more time to decide alternate path and configure the alternate path. Again there will be two flavours, (1) with router port + ZR and (2) others (ie. draft-ietf-teas-actn-poi-applicability) let's deep dive into the Fabio's slide in the next call.

As written in the original slides, the scenario is not a recovery scenario nor a multi-layer coordination scenario since it requires the ROADM to report whether the pre-FEC BER is above a given configured threshold.\r\n\r\nOne possibility is that this alert is used to trigger IP FRR protection for preventive traffic recovery.\r\n\r\nHowever, with the new FEC algorithms, it seems hard to predict when the FEC will stop correcting errors in time to perform preventive traffic recovery. This is an issue to discuss with FEC experts to see if there other parameters to monitor for preventive traffic recovery.\r\n",

MDSC is responsible for the E2E L2/L3VPN service PM monitoring considering also the inter-domain links which are under its scope but not directly seen by each P-PNC. So MDSC should support TCA settings for (L2/L3VPN segment1, SLA1) towards P-PNC1 and for (L2/L3VPN segment2, SLA2) towards P-PNC2. P-PNC1 and P-PNC2 only report to MDSC when either SLA1 in domain 1 or SLA2 in domain 2 cannot be fulfilled anymore (e.g. after a network failure ni domain 1 the rerouting that happened in the IP network doesn't meet the latency constraint part of SLA1).\r\nWe need also to have the possibility for troubleshooting to set OAM service management (creation/deletion of MEPs, MIPs, MEG) through P-PNCs so that they can report, through RESTCONF/YANG the key OAM values between the end points configured (e.g. packet loss, jitter, delay).\r\nIf we assume two separated optical domains as in draft POI then it is not applicable for optical but if we consider interconnected optical domain with multi-domain OTN services, then we should have same Performance management at MDSC level as for IP described above. Support as well of TCAs when provisioning each segment with its respective SLA in each optical domain, support of OAM management with TCMs in each segment from MDSC through the O-PNCs with capabilities from the O-PNCs to then report the service OAM KPIs back to MDSC who is in charge of the end-to-end OTN service.\r\nWe need to discuss how to address these points in the ToC. \r\nAll the TCA settings and OAM management between MDSC and P-PNCs/O-PNCs would need to be investigated.\r\nFor IP there is a YANG model \"draft-ietf-opsawg-yang-vpn-service-pm\" (RFC9375) but its applicability seems more focused on single domain.

Optical data plane standards provide a comprehensive set of OAM tools, defined in [ITU-T G.709] and [ITU-T G.798], that would assist O-PNC fault management, as described in [ITU-T G.7710] and [ITU-T G.874].\r\n> \r\n> It is worth noting that the OAM tools, defined in [ITU-T G.709] and [ITU-T G.798], are fully standardized for the ODU, OTU and FlexO sub-layers but only functionally standardized for the optical medial layer (i.e., OCh and OTSiA). This is not an issue since it is assumed that the optical NEs and O-PNC within a single domain are single-vendor.\r\n> \r\n> However, the level of standardization of the OAM tools management requirements is sufficient to allow defining standard requirements and data model at the MPI for multi-vendor, multi-domain and multi-layer fault management.\r\n> \r\n> Even if in this case the fault management is fully under the responsibility of the O-PNC, it is still needed to inform the MDSC that there is a failure within the optical domain and that the O-PNC is working on it.\r\n> \r\n> A failure within the optical network can cause secondary failure on multiple optical tunnels which can in turn cause failures on the multi-layer IP links and on the L2VPN and L3VPN services whose traffic is sent over the failed tunnels.\r\n> \r\n> For example, with a reference to Figure 7 of [ACTN POI], a failure within the optical network can cause a failure on the optical tunnel between NE11 and NE12. As a consequence, also the IP link between PE13 and BR11 is failed and the L2VPN/L3VPN xxx is also affected.\r\n> \r\n> The O-PNC can report the operational status of the optical tunnels to the MDSC to let the MDSC know that the optical tunnel is down. The MDSC can then correlate the failure of the optical tunnel (e.g., the optical tunnel between NE11 and NE12 in Figure 7 of [ACTN POI]) with the secondary failures on the L2VPN/L3VPN whose traffic has been routed through that optical tunnel.\r\n\r\n**Comment**: Need to discuss here why reporting the operational status of the optical tunnel is not sufficient to motivate the need for a more enhanced incident management as proposed in [draft-feng-opsawg-incident-management]\r\n\r\n> The MDSC should also inform the OSS/orchestration layer about the failures on the affected L2VPN/L3VPN services though mechanisms which are outside the scope of this document.\r\n> \r\n\r\n**Comment**: Need further discussion about the behavior of P-PNC. The P-PNC can also discover that the multi-layer IP link is down (e.g., using BFD). However, I think that the fault management process in P-PNC should be different from the case where the failed IP link is a single-layer IP link under P-PNC responsibility.\r\n\r\n**Comment**: The assumption in this text is that there are grey interfaces between the routers and the optical NEs. More investigation is needed for the scenarios where optical pluggable interfaces are used in the router. Three scenarios for WDM networks: grey interfaces, colored interfaces option 1 and colored interfaces option 2. To consider also the case with ODU switching.",

If, as it happens in many cases, the probability of a failure on the links between the IP routers and the edge ROADMs is quite low compared with the probability of a failure within the optical network, the availability provided by this configuration can also be higher (at a lower cost) that a single-layer protection and also be able to recover 100% of the IP traffic\r\n\r\nMy 2 cents\r\n\r\nItalo\r\n",

MDSC has acquired all the topology and status information of both the IP and optical layers.\r\n2. MDSC is fully aware of any multi-layer connections between the IP and the optical layers. It is also\r\naware of the multi-domain interconnection links between different IP domains.\r\n3. MDSC is aware of any topology or resource utilization change obtained in real time through coordination with the O/P-PNCs. This applies in the case of a fault or a maintenance activity involving either the IP or the DWDM layer.\r\n4. MDSC coordinates the IP and DWDM protections and, as a result, the re-routing of traffic at both the IP\r\nand DWDM layer. \r\n5. Before planned maintenance operation at the DWDM layer, MDSC instructs the P-PNC to move the affected IP traffic\r\nhitlessly to another link. This is done before the event takes place. MDSC also coordinates with P-PNC to revert\r\nback the traffic on the original path when the maintenance event is concluded.\r\n6. When the O-PNC detects a degradation of optical performance (e.g. BER PRE-FEC values threshold crossing over\r\na certain period of time), it alerts the MDSC so that the MDSC relates the warning to an IP link. \r\n7. MDSC distinguishes between IP and Optical failures. For example, in the case of the failure of an IP port of a router, \r\nthe IP traffic may be switched to a stand-by port, reusing the same ROADM optical resources (lambda, optical path) and keeping the end-to-end IP connection. If a remote IP node fails, then a re-route of optical resources takes place together with a switch of the local IP port in order to eatablish a new connection with a different IP node used for protection.",
